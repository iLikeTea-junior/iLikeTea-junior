## Hi there 👋

My name is Daniel. I am a junior software developer with basic to intermediate knowledge of web development.

I enjoy building fun and quirky projects, small and large, and I like learning by doing.

My main tech stack is: Javascript, Vue 3, HTML, CSS.
Languages: Python, Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS.
Frameworks: Vue 3, Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Jinja2, PostgreSQL, git.
Tools: Figma (My favorite tool to use btw).
Concepts: UX/UI Design, State Management, OOP (Object Oriented Programming), Component-based architecture.

Fun Facts:
- Right before christmas I uploaded my first youtube video on youtube.
- I don't have a mother language. I speak English with friends, Spanish with Family, and Dutch because I live in the Netherlands. I also know Papiamento (iykyk)
- I’m honest by default, but I try to wrap the truth nicely (if neccesary).
- Don't let mt face scare you away. I am a talkitive- chill guy, at least that is what my friend told me.

Hobbies:
- Gaming
- Edit, Make, and even watch youtube videos (for fun)
- Anime
